# Air Drumming

##Overview
This **Air Drum Project** allows you to play drums using hand movements and mouth captured by a camera. By moving your finger over different regions of the camera frame, corresponding drum sounds are triggered in real-time. This project demonstrates motion tracking and sound synthesis to create an interactive air drum experience.
